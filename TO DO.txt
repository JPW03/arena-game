Next things to do
- Player object further:
	- Stats (number of jumps, attacks, hits, etc)
- Main object
	- Options
- Menus
	- Buttons change colour when the cursor hovers over it.


Maybe do this:
- Store the settings in a config file



Fixed Bugs:
- Immediately moving back into the wall after dash wall jumping will cause the player to clip through the platform.
- Dashing into a wall on its left side will cause the player to clip through it.


Completed stuff:
- Make hitting a wall while dashing stop the dash
- Make hitting the ground while wall sliding stop wall sliding
- Implement wall jump action
- Make the dash fade "follow" the player (implement large position cache and constantly updating fade sprites)
- Entity manager
	- Constructor with each wave added to a list or vector
	- Update function, will check if all enemies of the wave are dead, etc.
- Main game loop
- Wave structs (ints for each enemy type)
- Hitbox collision detection (in EntityManager?)
- Health variables and damage functions
- Game Object:
	- Complete redo as a static class
	- Load and unload functions for loading/unloading arenas and starting/ending the game being played when exited to main menu
	- NewGame and LoadGame functions. Basic text file with number representing the wave to be started from.
- Ball AI: make the ball move around a platform properly
- Main menu
- Invinsibility frames: a timer that tracks how long since you've been hit and a boolean that locks the TakeDamage function
- Invinsibility frame visual indicator (Sprite impulsing)
- Ball object
	- Spawn projectiles (struct containing constant x and y velocities, a sprite, with a list that stores them)
	- Fix projectiles (limit velocity, account for negative velocities (maybe just use an angle instead of gradient), get animation working, get hitbox working)
- Basic hit sounds
- Attacks
	- Fix vertical boosts from up/down air
	- Stop all attacks from ending on the falling frame (except grd side for some reason)
- Filecache
	- Ability to load and play sound effects
- HUD
	- Player health display
	- Wave number display
