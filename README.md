# arena-game
2D action-platformer project I made for college in mid-2021. Made entirely from scratch with SFML.

All animated sprites were made by me in Aseprite.
Design documents and material for these animations are found in the 'Assets' folder.

Other assets used include:
- https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/castle-tileset/ for the solid arena platforms
- https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/100-colorful-seamless-pixel-art-tiles-tileset/ for the thin arena platforms
- All audio taken from https://opengameart.org/

This repository also includes various notes I used for debugging and design that I thought would be neat to archive for myself.

The project was made in Visual Studio 2019 (VisualC++15)

The only library used in this project is:
[SFML v2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)

If you for some reason want to build this for yourself, you will need to download and extract the 32-bit version of SFML v2.5.1 for VisualC++15 manually into 'ArenaGame 0.2.0/ArenaGame', then open the project in Visual Studio 2019.
