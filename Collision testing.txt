Bottom collision (player 3 pixels inside of the platform):
Player:
(492,727.045)
top of player = 727.045 - 22.5 = 704.545


Platform:
(500,700)
bottom of platform = 700 + 7.5 = 707.5

704.545 >= 707.5
false



Top collision (player touching top pixel):
Player:
(498.8,669.513)
bottom of player = 669.513 + 22.5 = 692.013

Platform:
(500,700)
top of platform = 700 - 7.5 = 692.5

692.013 <= 692.5
true


Bottom collision (player touching bottom pixel):
Player:
(501.9,729.265)
top of player = 729.265 - 22.5 = 706.765

Platform:
(500,700)
bottom of platform = 700 + 7.5 = 707.5

706.765 >= 707.5
false



Bottom collision if top of player = 707.5
Player:
(500,730)
top of player = 707.5

Platform (500,700)
Bottom of platform = 707.5

707.5 >= 707.5
true?
Player and platform just don't intersect I guess?



SOLUTION: Remove "- GetHeight() / 2" from if statement, however now the player is 1 pixel inside the platform when it collides
Warp player 1 pixel down? - Creates jittering but its hardly noticeable
