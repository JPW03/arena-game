Every frame is within a 128x128 area.

This allows for the origin of the player to remain constant relative to the coordinates of the 128x128 space.
This reduces algorithmic complexity whilst still fixing the sprite jittering caused by the origin auto adjusting to the centre of the texture rect

Origin = (63,63)

Frames:
1 - 2 = Idle
3 - 18 = Running
19 - 21 = Jumping
22 = Falling
23 = Wall slide
24 - 28 = Wall jump
